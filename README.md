# OMNeT++ Data Link Layer Simulation

This is a simulation of _Data Link_ layer using __OMNeT++__ on a centralized network architecture, created as the _Computer Networks_ course project.

## Included Protocols and Algorithms

-   Hamming Code (Error Detection/Correction).
-   Character Count (Framing).
-   Go Back N (Sliding Window Protocol).
-   Transmission Channel Noise Modelling.

The project contains a statistics gathering module that displays the transmission statistics periodically.

## Installation and Usage

-   Load the project using __OMNet++__, build and run the simulation.
